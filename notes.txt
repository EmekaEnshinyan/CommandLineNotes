[Get the wordcount]

syn: $wc [filename]

[Using piping to redirect]

def: redirects the output of one command/program/process to another
for further processing, i.e. it takes the output of a command and 
treats it as input for another command, which in turn will yield 
another output

[To view files that are actively changing]

syn: $tail -f [filename]
	**You can actively see the changes of the file
	ex: $ping www.google.com > google.log
	(open another terminal tab)
	$tail -f google.log

---NAVIGATING THROUGH A FILE---

[Basic Navigation]

def: allows you to print out file and use the arrow keys to scroll 
through it
syn: $less [filename]

[Find a word in the file]

syn: $less [filename]
	 abc
	 defg
	 :/[word]

[Move to next/previous search result]

$less [filename]
	 abc
	 defg
	 :/[word]
	 n/N

[Move to beginning/end of file]

beginning
syn: $less [filename]
	 abc
	 defg
	 :/G
syn: $less [filename]
	 abc
	 defg
	 :/1G

[Display the lines that match patterns/occurrences]

syn: $grep [word/pattern/etc.] [filename]
	ex: grep rose sonnets.txt
	...
	<displays only lines that contain rose>
	...
***Bear in mind that grep is case-sensitive. You can have

	lines that contain both rose and Rose

---MANIPULATING PROCESSES---

[Find a process]

---DIRECTORIES---

[Get superuser priviliges to issue commands]

syn: $sudo [command]

[Make a directory]

									extension and put it in the text_files folder

[Show contents of dir]

syn: $ls -dl [dir]

[Changing dir from where commands will be given]
